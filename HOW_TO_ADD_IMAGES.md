# How to Add Your Images to the Website

## Quick Steps

1. **Save your logo image** (the one with "button'd" text and the button character) as `logo.png` in the `public` folder
   - Replace the existing `public/logo.png` file
   - Recommended: PNG format with transparent background
   - Size: 400x400px or larger (square)

2. **Save your mascot image** (the button character holding a briefcase) as `mascot.png` in the `public` folder
   - Replace the existing `public/mascot.png` file
   - Recommended: PNG format with transparent background
   - Size: 256x256px or larger (square)

3. The website will automatically use your images once you replace the placeholder files!

## Image Locations

- **Logo**: Used in the hero section (top right of the homepage)
- **Mascot**: Used in the "Heart Centered Approach" section (middle of the page)

## Notes

- The images you provided in the chat are perfect for this!
- Just save them with the exact filenames mentioned above
- The website uses Next.js Image optimization, so your images will be automatically optimized for web
- If you need to use different image formats (JPG, WebP, etc.), just update the file extension in `app/page.tsx`
